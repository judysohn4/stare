              Roe v. Wade was a prominent lawsuit that began when a pregnant but unmarried Texas woman, Jane Roe, filed the suit to challenge Texas’ abortion laws at the time.
At the time when getting an abortion was considered a crime unless the procedure was to save a woman’s life, a Texas doctor also supported Roe as he argued that the present laws regarding abortion were too vague.
Against Roe, Texas argued that states have a responsibility to maintain medical standards, preserve health as well as prenatal life. Under the 14th amendment, those who supported abortion restrictions argued that a fetus is still considered a person and must therefore be protected by the amendment.
On the other hand, Roe claimed the absolute abortion rights were necessary in order to fall under an individual’s right to liberty under the 14th amendment. By refusing the right to an abortion, Texas was, according to Roe, infringing on the rights of marital, familial, and sexual privacy guaranteed by the Bill of Rights.
At the time of this suit, the justices acknowledged that forced pregnancy continuation entails risks, including physical and mental health, financial burden and social stigma.
While the constitution does not clearly provide a definition of a “person,” it is written that the United States will provide protection for those “born and naturalized.” As a result, after examining precedent cases, the Court settled that “the unborn have never been recognized in the law as persons in the whole sense,” which nullified the state’s argument that life begins at conception.
On the other hand, the Court disagreed with Roe in that Constitution guarantees absolute abortion rights, giving states the right to put regulations on abortions. Following this statement, the Court wrote a framework to balance the state’s interest with individuals’ privacy rights by dividing pregnancy into three 12-week trimesters, according to supreme.findlaw.com: During a pregnant person's first trimester, the Court held, a state cannot regulate abortion beyond requiring that the procedure be performed by a licensed doctor in medically safe conditions. During the second trimester, the Court held that a state may regulate abortion if the regulations are reasonably related to the health of the pregnant person. During the third trimester of pregnancy, the state's interest in protecting the potential human life outweighs the right to privacy. As a result, the state may prohibit abortions unless an abortion is necessary to save the life or health of the pregnant person.
In conclusion, this 1973 Roe v. Wade case altered the state’s power to regulate abortion and established abortion as a topic covered under constitutional privacy rights.
Contrary to some misconceptions, Roe v. Wade was not the case the wholly legalized abortion. States with representatives who are abortion opponents have opted for stricter abortion limitations, like arental notification requirements, mandatory disclosure of abortion risk information, and restrictions on late-term abortions.

  <div><b>ROE V. WADE TO 2022 INTERIM</b></div>
  <br/>
  Despite the conclusions made during the Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court reevalted abortion rights once again in subsequent cases.
For example, in Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, which was initiated when Texas placed several restrictions on abortion clinics in 2013. More specifically, abortion providers were given “admitting privileges” at hospitals within 30 miles away that granted the doctor the ability to have patients admitted at the hospitials as if he or she was an employee there and were given freedom on how to treat the patient without approval from another doctor at the hospital, according to supreme.findlaw.com.
After these privileges went into effect, the number of abortion clinics in Texas decreased from 42 to 19.
Once this case reached the Supreme Court, the eight justices concluded that the state could not have the ability to set limitations that created an “undue burden” for women seeking abortions.
In 19992, Planned Parenthood v. Casey was another landmark case that would be refuted
Then the infamous shared leaked draft opinion on May 2 — largely reflected the opinions of Justice Samuel Alito on Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health — set the path for the controversial overturning of Roe v. Wade.
<br/> <br/>
<div><b class = "font-bold">ROE V. WADE OVERTURNED</b></div>
<br/>
Though the leak was only a draft, confirmed to be authentic by the Supreme Court, it sent a wave of disturbance to abortion supporters at the potential of the constitutional right to abortion being revoked.
In this draft opinion regarding the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health that was obtained by Politico, Alito explicitly expressed his holding that Roe was “egregiously wrong” in that the decision made nearly 50 years ago has unclear roots in the Constitution.
Moreover, it was suggested that four other justices were inclined to sign onto Alito’s first draft.
A month later, the final decision made by the Supreme Court was released in which Alito and the four other conservatives voted for the overturn of Roe while three liberals opposed.
More specifically, the 6-3 ruling allowed individual states to choose their own abortion regulations without being limited by the boundaries of Roe. As a result, nine states — including some that had trigger bans* on abortion —have opted to ban abortions in almost all circumstances, unless the pregnancy is not life threatening to the pregrant person and is not over six weeks, a point when many people do not know if they have conceived.
On the other hand, some states have alternated their legal status on abortion multiple times and the more liberal states have openly announced that they will remain a safe haven for women all across the United States seeking reproductive health care.

NOTE FROM WRITER: While I respect the millions of Americans out there today who must have rooted for the overturn of Roe v. Wade for their profoundly owned reasons, it grieves me that so many women have lost the bodily autnomy that they rightfully deserve.
